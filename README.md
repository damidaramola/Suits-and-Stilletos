## Testing

* I have tested and can confirm that this page works in various browsers such as Firefox, Chrome and Safari

* I confirmed that the header and navigation are all easy to understand and clear.


## Unfixed Bugs
* When I tested my sign-up page in the WC3 validator, I realised that my form had errors as I was not supposed to use the span element, followed by H5 or p to section my form.

* I also had issues with the sizing of my images on the resource page.

* I had a problem with the positioning of my footer.

## Validator Testing

* HTML 
 6 errors were found with my form in the sign-up page, stemming from the 1 error of using the spam element for my form

* Accessibility
 I can confirm that the colours and fonts used in the website are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in dev tools.
